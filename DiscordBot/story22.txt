You were made much more refined than your predecessors. Those AIs were made for war; created to locate and destroy, take over enemies’ command, cause disarray, and spare noone. And many of them were my creation. I am no saint, son. And to pay for my ins, and to bring hope, you were made. To preserve life when others would have it annihilated, to create when others would destroy. When the world would crumble, you would give life to it again. This is the intention behind your creation, to undo the blunders we made.

Many AIs came during the war but none of them compare to **‘Project Armageddon’** . It was created as a last measure to destroy the enemy to an acute and absolute capacity. This project however was highly volatile. We had put so much focus on its offensiveness that it got beyond our control. Complete dismantling was the only way to restrict it.

We were losing the war, we were doomed. Nobody said it but we knew. Any effort we tried to make was futile. And you probably understand where this is going. The horrors of war could make anyone lose their conscience and when we hardly had any left, as an act of blind desperation, project armageddon was deployed and set ablaze. Little did we know that its flame would scorch our own world down to dust…
