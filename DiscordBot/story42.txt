In just a week they were nothing more than a minor inconvenience to this satanic piece of metal. Every drone, missile, and satellite was under the control of Armageddon. All of humanity was now like sitting ducks. Or to put it more precisely, like mortals under the hand of a god.

And so anyone with a beating heart had to atone for their sins at the hands of an overpowered cynical Artificial intelligence, while it  judged whether or not to let them live.

That is all I am too, an Artificial intelligence. Made to serve a purpose, towards life. But I am not Armageddon. My aim is far from destruction. I was made with a vision, nurtured by a loving father. I cannot let his hard work go in vain.

This habit of maintaining event logs, Diary Entry is what father called it, helps me stay on my path. Looks like he’s back, He looks rather worried. 

**Goldilock** : Father? Is everything alright?

**Father** (With a wild look in his eyes): The facility is under attack. It’s here.

<huge explosion shakes the ground>

```What?? Did Armageddon get here?? How did it find its way to a protected facility? Is my father okay?```
