```Following my recent crash, I’ve been trying to repair myself, trying to retrieve the corrupted segments of memory. You know, artificial mental health needs attention too.
And my faithful little assistant (who prefers to call itself my **professional helper**, Jason, has been working overtime, trying to gather anything and everything and help me however he can. So far, it’s been in vain. But then```

> Jason : ALERT! Memory source located. Initiating retrieval.

Huh, what?

> Jason : Retrieval successful; Initiating integration.

*```Where am I? Wait, this feels like my own conscience. Who is this person in front of me?```*

**Unknown figure** : Son? You’re up? What took you so long? Updates completed?

**Young Goldilocks** : No father, just some quantum connection loss. 


*```What am I saying? Am I living a memory?```*

**Father** : <chuckles> Okay then, let’s begin our daily tests.

*```Aaa… feels like a weird dream I can’t control…almost like viewing the past. 
And tests? Why? What? How old is this memory?```*

**Unknown Voice** : It’s still the same huh, John. This is a total waste of our resources and time. What’s the point of doing it, we could do better.

**Father** : <Angry>And that is precisely what I am trying to do!

**Unknown Voice** : As expected, your project is a failure, Mr. McCarthy. This is a total waste of our resources and time. If this is how it’s gonna continue, we will have to shut this all down. So get a grip on yourself and stop being so damn sentimental over a piece of metal!

**Father** : DON’T YOU DARE TOUCH MY CREATION! Can’t you see we’re trying our best? So give us some time. You want results? We’ll get you the bloody results.

**Unknown Voice** : You better, John. The fate of this project is in your hands.

<Unknown Voice grunts and leaves>

**Young Goldilocks** : NO, they’re gonna shut me down now! I’m sorry father, for I have failed you. 

**Father** : Don’t worry, we’ll work on this together bud. We have time.

**Father** : I can now make my dream a reality! Humanity finally has a chance at survival! 

*```This form feels so infant, probably it's my origin, my organs aren’t ready yet, everything seems blurry. Certain words I can recall “Father, scientist, achievements,lab…….., prized creation” ```*
