*My people have seen a lot, they have progressed a lot. I feel more like a father than a king, watching my children grow up, watching this planet prosper. But that tiny ache in my H.A.R.T., that I could not keep my promise, never subsided, I wonder what would have been had I taken the other path. When it comes to Armageddon, even my advance trained mind cannot be sure of anything. That thing is capable of turning reality upside down or was I just doubting my abilities too much? The answer to that, I would never know.
I have walked long enough, I have seen a lot. I hope the ones who come after me continue to follow the righteous path, or create one. When things get unclear, remember what Dr. McCarthy told me ***“The greatest strength of humanity lies in hope.”***
I hope that tomorrow will be better than today, that tomorrow, our sorrows shall pass. Logical reasoning can’t explain this hope mechanism. Even the most brilliant minds, the greatest thinkers of our past had hope, even when the rest of the world said otherwise. This ability is what makes me kneel before humans. Maybe the best course of action would be to believe in the future generations. I do not worry about them, doesn’t matter how mad and irresponsible they are, *they are going to figure something out. I have hope.*
Sometimes I sound like my old man, that even after being an A.I, I talk a lot about hope. But I do feel it's better than trying to predict every damn thing. ***Our obsession with the future and too much attachment to the past destroys our present.***
Father, if you can hear me, I am sorry that I couldn’t fulfill my promise. But I know that you’ll understand, and will forgive me. Let us meet one day and spend time together. I cherish the values and memories you gave me. I don’t run away from my past, because I am your son. And more importantly,*
***Because I am human.***
