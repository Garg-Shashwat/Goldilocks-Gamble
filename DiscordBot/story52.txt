**Father**:  Goldilock.. My creation. You know your mission, your goal, the reason for your existence. Remember that. 

<rubble falling from above>

You are and will be my most prized creation. When you start your own civilization on 4546b, you mustn’t forget about this world. You must learn from all our mistakes, and start anew. Make sure you build a better one.

We messed up, make sure you do not. It’s really important that you remember your home, Earth. Let your memories be your guiding light. I want you to know that even after all that this planet has been through, it’s still worth saving. There’s still hope and that is the greatest power of our kind, to take the leap of faith, to face head on the unknown and you are one of us!
