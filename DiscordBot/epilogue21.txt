*Many years have passed by, and the civilization established by Goldilocks continues to thrive. It has seen its golden ages, it has seen its dark ages.
Some archaeologists have been digging up the site of Noah’s Ark’s burial, where they find this engraving on the ship.

We often find ourselves standing at a crossroads, one path we ought to pick. The weird thing is that whatever choice I make, I shall always live with a sense of loss. And here, my loss is not being able to fulfill my promise, a promise I made a long time ago. A promise that I never meant to break. The two worlds I have seen are poles apart, one in ruins, the one I originated from, and the other flourishing, the one I created, one, I am proud of.
I still remember the time I landed here, a complete novice, despite having done so much training back on earth. I was lost, I was clueless, I did not know what to do. But as time progressed, I ended up making many right choices,or so it seemed. Most, I remember, rest, I don’t want to. Who would have thought that an A.I could have regrets? But it’s still a journey worth remembering, one that I always want to keep alive in my storage-slots.*
