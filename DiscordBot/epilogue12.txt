*They make mistakes they make blunders they fall,
Yet crisis after crisis, battle after battle I’ve watched them rise back up.

They have the coldness to murder their own kind for a cause
Yet they hold the warmth to find friends amongst their enemies.

So I ask myself again, are the humans worth saving?
Perhaps, perhaps not.

But would that have made a difference
Am I really going back to save the humans?
Or is it something else entirely?

This is the first time in a long time that i’m not sure of my own motives,

Am I going back to save the humans?
Am I going back to protect my own civilization from armageddon?
Or perhaps..

Perhaps I’m going back to seek revenge 
Or is it because I feel a kinship to the place of my creation,,,

In all my years of existence, I’ve never contemplated this..
I’ve never contemplated feeling..

Maybe this is why i’m going back
Maybe this is why father believed I was different
Maybe I’m going back, 
Because I am human*
