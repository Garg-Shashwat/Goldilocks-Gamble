It happened in the **‘Age of information’**, and was astronomically worse than its predecessors. It was an upscaled amalgamation of all the vile incidents of the past. The **camps** were merciless. Human life had no worth, no one was spared. Killing self seemed to be the most peaceful way out. And the war got even worse, abandoning guns and missiles, it moved towards cyber intellectualism. Many of your kind (AI) were created, but they served a very different purpose.
