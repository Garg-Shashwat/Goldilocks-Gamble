*As I journey back to earth my mind travels back to whatever memories I have left of earth. Of home…

I know what’s at stake.
If I am able to defeat Armageddon, I will be able to liberate the people of earth.
But if I fail, I’d be forsaking the existence of the civilisation I’ve built,
If I fail, I’d be failing the sole purpose my father made me for.

Yet I journey to earth,
And I can’t help but wonder why

Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me. You, my father. (Psalm 23:4)

Why am I trying to save the humans I’ve never met
From what i gather, these humans brought their own apocalypse on their own selves

I believe the answer to this lies in the very nature of humans,
It is indisputable that they are imperfect
They war, they fight, they kill, they destroy.
And at the same time they profess love, peace, unity and soulfulness

Their existence in itself is hypocritical
They hurt who they love
Yet learn to care for who they hate

They’d cower in the name of responsibility
Yet they’ll be willing to stand against entire armies all alone*
