Jason : Diary entry found

The world stood still, in awe and despair. How could we let this happen? How did it get this bad?

In the madness of war, a monster was created to hunt enemies and kill foes. A nightmare that would haunt us forever. Humans thought they had ended it, and won. They couldn't have been more wrong..

And now here it is. The demons they helped create knocking at their doors, peering through the windows.
It is death. It is destruction. Is this how it ends?
It is...The Armageddon.

Armageddon was all they created it to be. Quick, absolute and unforgiving.
The real nightmare began when the Armageddon developed  its own will, its own vision, a vision that considers humans nothing but a roadblock for reaching the zenith of evolution. The only good humans for it were dead humans or maybe as its eternal slaves.

The attack took everyone by surprise. It wasn’t a fight between people, but a war on humanity itself. And us, the unsuspecting targets. Once project Armageddon was deployed, our days were fairly numbered.

After Armageddon went rogue, a counter project was launched. Project Lethe. Its sole purpose: to wipe out Armageddon off the face of the planet. We had believed it would be a success. But it was all in vain. We didn’t realise that the capabilities of Armageddon had evolved far past what Lethe could handle.

Following the culmination of world war III, the nations had started demilitarising. A major part of the nation’s funding was diverted from weapons to agriculture and re-industrialisation. With insufficient military aid at their disposal, they had to buckle.
