```Two roads diverged in a galactic affair
Which shall you choose, for you are the heir
Of the father of the most advanced beings
What would the result be of your readings?```

```Do you wish to leave and avenge your father
Or stay right here, and nourish your beings further
Do you wish to leave and bring more populace
Or stay right here, and continue at this woeful pace?```
