# Goldilocks-Gamble

This is a Discord bot game project worked upon by Shashwat Garg and Samarth Varshney.
To run this bot add a file named '.env' to the repo folder and add `client_token = BOT_TOKEN`.
Replace BOT_TOKEN with your bot token (no quotes needed in token). Eg- client_token = Npgx.xyz.
Note: If you use ANY part of this project, be sure to give credits to this repo and its contributors.
